# GUI Mockup

## Main GUI (Bits Shown and Iteration Used)

![GUI Mockup 1](http://i.imgur.com/FBnOQT6.png)

Our mockup has a UGA theme. Additionaly, each button is a seperate .png file. The field
for user input (as in when they type 9 * 9, for example) is located as the first line.
Output information, such as when the user clicks enter, is located at on the second line (ex. 81).
The third line is where the togglable binary number is located. The small red numbers are simply 
line markers for ease of use.

## GUI with Bits Hidden and Recursion Used

Here is another image...

This mockup includes the binary bits toggled off and Recursion being used. This shows how the buttons
will change the .png file they display, rather than updating the text. We designed it this way to
easily switch modes graphically.

## Additional Interface Elements

The interface will use iteration for its math operations when "Use Recursion" is displayed.
The interface will use recursion for its math operations when "Use Iteration" is displayed.
The interface will show the binary bits when "Hide Binary" is displayed.
The interface will hide the binary bits when "Show Binary" is displayed.

In other words, the buttons reflect what the user wants to change the calculator to do, not what it is
currently doing.
